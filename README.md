# Game of PostgreSQL (catchy title!)

Please listen to the Game of Thrones title music whilst reading this readme. For dramatic effect. 


### Goals

1. Build an end to end application using real data
2. Use SQL joins
3. Use complex SQL Queries
4. Improve understanding of Express / PGP / Testing in backend
5. Learn how to use EJS  


### Instructions

You have been tasked with creating a wiki for Game of Thrones. The seed file has been provided for you. 

Your server should have the following available: 

- The ability to get all houses
- The ability to add a house
- The ability to get all people
- The ability to add a person
- The ability to get all people who pass a certain criteria (using queries). The queries should be available for 'dead' and 'religion' 
- The ability to change a character's record to mark them as dead/alive (it happens a lot in Game of Thrones so we should make it easy on our wiki!)
- The ability to get all people for a particular house
- The ability to get all religions
- The ability to add a religion
- The ability to get all religions for a particular house

All your routes should be fully tested.


### Templating

We are going to build views to display our wiki data using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) There is more EJS reading and a great tutorial on [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-ejs-to-template-your-node-application).

EJS has been around for a long time. Its first commit on GitHub was over six years ago. It has almost 1.5 million downloads per month from npm and is widely used to create MVC (Model-View-Controller) application with JavaScript and express.

You should work with EJS to provide attractive templates to display all of this information. Characters and houses should have their images displayed in a standard size. The list of all houses/people should display their images as thumbnails.
